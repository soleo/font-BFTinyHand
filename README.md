# BF Tiny Hand

The BF Tiny Hand Font, Designed by Mark Davis


### Introduction

This font is designed by Mark Davis. You could find more information from http://www.designermarkdavis.com/BF-Tiny-Hand

You could download it from https://www.dropbox.com/s/irvgp4813izfbso/BFTinyHand-Regular.zip?dl=0 . The original zip file only included a .otf format font file which doesn't support well for all browsers. I used a script to generate ttf, svg, eot, woff and woff2 format to better support different browsers, so if you are interested in use it in a web based app, I'd recomend you to download from [here](https://github.com/soleo/font-BFTinyHand/archive/master.zip) to get this amazing font.
